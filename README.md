    -   ### Typography

-   Add more pages detailing the game history and ongoing updates since it is a game as a service.
-   Any user suggested features, e.g. improvement to questions and options or to add more to question pool.

## Testing 

### Functional Testing 

-   Landing Page login form
    -   There is form in the header that the user can add their name to and have that input appear in the heading of the home page.
    -   This data is saved to local storage and can be eased when a click of the button again.
    -   The headings, then return to default.

-   Navigation Bar 
    -   The navigation bar stays on the top of the page and has links to the home and quiz page.
    -   The active page is highlighted so that the user knows at all time what page they are on. 
    -   On hovering over the pages the text color changes to let the user know what they are about to click on.
    -   As the screen gets smaller a three line box on the right side and the quiz page get hidden and the form drops below.
    -   The user can then click on the three line box to display the quiz page link. The home page and quiz links then appear as a drop down and take the full navigation bar.
    -   The home page link remains on the navigation bar at all times so the user can easily navigate back if an error occurs.

-   The footer
    -   The footer holds two buttons that open different modals. One is a simple about button that displays a text about the general purpose of the site. The second is a form where the user can send an email to the site developer.
    -   Both buttons have an animation when clicked and creates a dim effect on the background which allows the content being clicked on to be focussed. 
    -   The rest of the buttons are links to the various destiny 2 social media and main website page.
    -   The user can then click on the x icon on the modals or on any blank section of the screen to close the content.
    -   The form sends an email through emailjs to the developer using a template created on emailjs. It retrieves the user's email, name and a message from the form and sends the information as an email to the site developer.
    -   As the screen size reduces the footer buttons move to the center and reduce in size to fit the screen.

-   Images
    -   All images used are responsive depending on the screen sizes viewing the content.
    -   Only the main landing image and home page image do not have responsiveness. This is because at various screen sizes, different parts of the image can be viewed and does not affect the user experience as the majority of the main image can still be seen.

-   Quiz page
    -   This page holds the majority of the javascript. Initially all the javascript was located on one page which caused an error of having different evernt listeners waiting to be called due it being on a different page. Therefore, the scripts were split into three, one for the quiz, one for the landing image and the local storage function and lastely one that they share is the mainscript which hold the naviagation function and modal functions for the footer.
    -   The quiz begins when the button is clicked and the questions are chosen at random through the question array, once the last question is answered the points get tallyed bewteen the 3 choices.
