    -   ### Color Scheme
        -   The Main colors used in the site was taken from Destiny 2 the game loading screen. Then using mycolor.space I got a palette of accompanying colors.
        -   I used #051652 for the main background color, for the footer and header. Then various shades of that color for the different sections e.g expand this plz..

    -   ### Imagery 
        -   Each page has images from Destiny 2 the game. Majority of which are cartoon representations of the characters which make it light and fun to look at.
